# design-patterns-with-solid-principles
A master guide to gang of four design patterns &amp; SOLID design principles using Java.
<p>
What are SOLID Design Principles?

These principles enable you to write most reusable & clean Java code in your projects.

<b>SOLID Principles</b> which are:

1.1 Single Responsibility Principle - There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

1.2 Open-Closed Principle - Software entities(classes, modules, methods etc) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

<b>Open for Extension -> Extends existing behaviour

Closed for Modification -> Existing code remains unchanged</b>

1.3 Liskov Substitution Principle - We should be to substitute base class object with child class objects & this should not alter the behaviour/characterirstics of program. 

1.4 Interface Segregation Principle - Clients should not be forced to depend upon Interfaces that they do not use(Interface Pollution).

<b>write highly cohesive interfaces</b>

1.5 Dependency Inversion Principle

<p>A. High level modules should not depend on low level modules, both should depend on Abstractions.</p>
<p>B. Abstractions should not depend upon details, details should depend upon abstraction.</p>
</p>
<b>Creational Design Patterns:</b> 

2.1 Simple Factory

2.2 Abstract Factory

2.3 Factory Method

2.4Singleton

2.5 Builder: <b>what problem builder design patterns solve?</b>

* class constructor requires lot of information.
* In builder, we remove the logic related to object construction from "client" code & abstract it in to separate classes.

2.6 Prototype

2.7 Object Pool

<b>Structural Design Patterns:</b> 

3.1 Object & Class Adapters

3.2 Decorator

3.3 Bridge

3.4 Facade

3.5 Static & Dynamic Proxy

3.6 Flyweight

3.7 Composite  

<b>Behavioral Design Patterns:</b>

4.1 Chain of Responsibility

4.2 Command

4.3 Interpreter

4.4 Mediator

4.5 Iterator

4.6 Memento

4.7 Observer

4.8 State

4.9 Strategy

4.10 Template Method

4.11 Visitor

4.12 Null Object
